            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Alex Peterson and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at UCF. I've been programming since high school and have been in love with it ever since! 

                I originally made this site inbetween semesters to have something to work on, but since then it has grown enough for me to want to publish online. 

                Most of this code involves the p5js library, a Javascript library meant for creative coding, which I use to visualize various computer science concepts and games that interest me. </p>
